# Reinforcement Learning Based Herd Strategy Development

Leading our team on a competition to design deep reinforcement learning algorithms that learn the most effective offensive, defensive and resource gathering strategies for mixed swarms from air and ground vehicles. The competition is organized by Defence Industry Agency of Turkey. Our team is one of the finalists and competition is ongoing. [Comptetion website](https://y3.ssyz.org.tr/y3/competition/suru)

# Autonomous Vehicle Navigation with Deep Reinforcement Learning (Databoss Inc.)

Developed various reinforcement learning-based navigation algorithms to realize a self-driving military terrain vehicle while reducing any human intervention to a practical and feasible extent. Our algorithms mainly based on TD3, DDPG, DQN and their variants with a meaningful reward shaping to navigate a designated vehicle by using end-to-end deep reinforcement learning.[Video1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cydSGHRMMQOVA6G1NzMHNKAsRVR-L5H2/view?usp=sharing)
