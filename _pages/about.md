Hi, I am Dogan Can Cicek, and I am a Machine Learning Researcher. Currently, I obtained my M.S. degree at [Bilkent University Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department](https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/), Ankara, Turkey under the supervision of [Prof. Suleyman Serdar Kozat](http://www.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~kozat/). I received my B.Sc. degree from Electrical and Electronics Engineering and my Minor degree in Economics at Bilkent University. 

My current research interests are **Autonomous Driving**, **Decision Making Systems**, **Deep Reinforcement Learning** and its real-life applications. I am also interested in **Natural Language Processing**.

During my M.S. studies, I was part of an R&D team as a Machine Learning Expert at [Databoss Inc](http://data-boss.com.tr), developing various machine learning projects such as Anomaly Detection in Natural Language Processing, Spatio Temporal Event Detection, Indoor Autonomous Vehicle Navigation and Outdoor Autonomous Vehicle Navigation. I have also served as a Teaching Asssistant for several courses in Bilkent University. For more information, please check the [Experience](/experience/) page!

I have authored **nine papers** mainly related to Deep Reinforcement Learning and Autonomous Vehichle Navigation. If you are interested and want to check or read each of them, I present the list of my publications on the [Publications](/publications/) page!
